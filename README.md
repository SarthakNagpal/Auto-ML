# Auto-ML

My Streamlit ML Analyzer is a simple and interactive web application built with Streamlit and scikit-learn. It allows users to upload datasets, choose between regression or classification tasks, and performs machine learning analysis accordingly. The app displays key performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared (for regression), Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score (for classification). It provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring machine learning models without the need for extensive coding.

### Features:

* Upload and explore datasets with ease.
* Choose between regression or classification tasks.
* Perform machine learning analysis using scikit-learn.
* Visualize key performance metrics for model evaluation.

### Usage:

1. Upload your dataset.
2. Choose the type of ML task (regression or classification).
3. Select the target column.
4. Click the button to perform ML analysis.

This Streamlit app simplifies the process of experimenting with machine learning models, making it accessible to users without extensive programming knowledge.
